# bulk-html-mailer
<!-- [![Ask DeepWiki](https://devin.ai/assets/askdeepwiki.png)](https://deepwiki.com/NienCongChua/bulk-html-mailer.git) -->

A Python-based bulk email sender with support for popular responsive HTML templates, SMTP integration, and dynamic personalization.

## Features

*   **Bulk Email Sending:** Efficiently send emails to a large list of recipients.
*   **HTML Template Support:** Utilize responsive HTML templates for visually appealing emails. Ensure your HTML templates are designed to be responsive across various email clients.
*   **SMTP Integration:** Connect to any standard SMTP server for email dispatch (e.g., Gmail, SendGrid, Mailgun, or your own).
*   **Dynamic Personalization:** Personalize email content (subject and body) using placeholders (e.g., `{{name}}`, `{{customer_id}}`) that are dynamically filled from recipient data.
*   **Recipient Management:** Typically handles recipient lists imported from common formats like CSV files.

## Prerequisites

*   Python 3.6+
*   Access to an SMTP server (with credentials: host, port, username, password/app-specific password).

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/NienCongChua/bulk-html-mailer.git
    cd bulk-html-mailer
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    This project may have dependencies listed in a `requirements.txt` file. If such a file exists or is added, install them using:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    Core functionalities would rely on Python's built-in `smtplib` and `email.mime` modules. Additional libraries for CSV parsing or advanced templating (like Jinja2) might be used.

## Configuration

Configuration is crucial for the mailer to function correctly. You will typically need to configure the following:

*   **SMTP Server Details:**
    *   Host (e.g., `smtp.gmail.com`)
    *   Port (e.g., `587` for TLS, `465` for SSL)
    *   Username (your email address or SMTP login)
    *   Password (your email password or an app-specific password if using services like Gmail with 2FA)
*   **Sender Information:**
    *   Sender Email Address (the "From" address)
    *   Sender Name (the display name for the "From" address)
*   **Email Content:**
    *   Path to your HTML email template file.
    *   Path to your recipient data file (e.g., a CSV).
    *   Default Subject line (can also be personalized).

These configurations might be set via:
*   A dedicated configuration file (e.g., `config.json`, `config.yaml`, `.env`).
*   Environment variables.
*   Command-line arguments when executing the script.

Refer to the script's specific implementation details or documentation (if available within the codebase) for how to set these up.

## Usage

The exact command to run the bulk mailer will depend on the primary Python script (e.g., `main.py`, `mailer.py`).

**General Steps:**

1.  **Prepare your recipient list:**
    Create a CSV file (e.g., `recipients.csv`) with columns for `email` and any other fields you want to use for personalization. The first row should be the header.
    Example `recipients.csv`:
    ```csv
    email,name,product_name,discount_code
    john.doe@example.com,John Doe,Awesome Widget,WELCOME10
    jane.smith@example.com,Jane Smith,Super Gadget,SAVE20
    ```

2.  **Create your HTML email template:**
    Design an HTML file (e.g., `template.html`) for your email. Use placeholders for dynamic content that match the column headers in your CSV file.
    Example `template.html`:
    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <title>Your Subject Here</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>Hi {{name}},</p>
        <p>Thank you for your interest in the {{product_name}}!</p>
        <p>Use the discount code <strong>{{discount_code}}</strong> for a special offer.</p>
        <p>Best regards,<br>The Team</p>
    </body>
    </html>
    ```

3.  **Run the script:**
    Execute the mailer script, providing paths to your recipient list, HTML template, and any other required arguments (like subject line or configuration file).
    A hypothetical command might look like:
    ```bash
    python mailer.py --config settings.json --csv recipients.csv --template template.html --subject "A Special Offer For You, {{name}}!"
    ```
    Ensure you consult the script's help `(-h or --help)` if available, or its source code for actual command-line arguments.

## Personalization

Personalization allows you to tailor emails to each recipient.

*   **Placeholders:** Use placeholders in your HTML template and subject line (e.g., `{{column_header}}`). These placeholders correspond to the column headers in your recipient CSV file.
*   **Data Mapping:** The script will read each row from your CSV, and for each email, it will replace the placeholders with the corresponding values from that recipient's row.
*   **Fallback Values:** (If supported by the script) Consider if there's a mechanism for default values if a recipient's data for a placeholder is missing.
